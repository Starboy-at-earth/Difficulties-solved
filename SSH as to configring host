sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh

if the above one prompts activated, then input the following command in the console:
  sudo ufw allow ssh   #Comment: I guess ufw is a shorthand for universal fire wall.

After the above three commands are executed, then you should install the client on your own working device.
